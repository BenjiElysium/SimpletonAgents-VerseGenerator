Introduction
Simpleton: Verse Generator is built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo chat model, which facilitates a simulated interaction between three agents:

Poet: Creates a short poem in the style of Italo Calvino.
Translator: Translates the poem into another language or provides an interpretation of the poem.
Editor: Reviews the poem and provides feedback or suggestions for improvement.
By simulating conversations between these agents, Simpleton: Verse Generator allows users to explore the creative potential of AI-generated poetry while gaining insights into the translation and editing processes.
