The Simpleton Agents Verse Generator is built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo chat model, which facilitates a simulated interaction between three agents:

Agent 1: The Poet - Creates a short poem in the style of Italo Calvino.
Agent 2: The Proof Reader - Corrects the poem to replace non-sensical words with similar sounding proper English words.
Agent 3: The Editor - Edits the poem to provide structure and readibility.
By simulating conversations between these agents, Simpleton: Verse Generator allows users to explore the creative potential of AI-generated poetry while gaining insights into the translation and editing processes.
